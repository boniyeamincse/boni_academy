Sample KPI Queries (SQL-ish)

Revenue (last 30d)
SELECT SUM(total) FROM orders WHERE status='paid' AND created_at>=NOW()-INTERVAL '30 days';

Active Learners (7d)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) FROM events WHERE verb IN('lesson.view','quiz.submit') AND ts>=NOW()-INTERVAL '7 days';

Completion Rate
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE completed_at IS NOT NULL)::float/COUNT(*) FROM enrollments WHERE started_at>=NOW()-INTERVAL '30 days';

Payment Fail Rate
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN status='failed' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::float/COUNT(*) FROM orders WHERE created_at>=NOW()-INTERVAL '30 days';

Proctoring Flags per 100 Attempts
SELECT 100.0*SUM(proctor_flags)::float/COUNT(*) FROM attempts WHERE opened_at>=NOW()-INTERVAL '30 days';
